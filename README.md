## Overview

This is a Data Science project by Beomseong Kim and Ikjoo Oh under the guidance of mentors John Oh and Arden Kim. 

Used Dataset: Kaggle[Bank Chustomer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn/data)

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank based on historical data. Understanding the predictors of customer churn can help the bank in designing effective retention programs and improving customer satisfaction.

## Data Description
1. CreditScore(`int`) — Customer credit score
2. Geography(`object`) — Customer location
3. Gender(`object`) — Gender of the customer
4. Age(`int`) — Customer age
5. Tenure(`int`) — Duration of the customer relationship with the bank
6. Balance(`float`) — Account balance
7. NumOfProducts(`int`) — number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
8. HasCrCard(`int`) — denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card
9. IsActiveMember(`int`) — Indicator of active membership status
10. EstimatedSalary(`float`) — Customer Salary
11. Complain(`int`) — Indicator of customer complaints
12. Satisfaction Score(`int`) — Score provided by the customer for their complaint resolution
13. Card Type(`object`) — Type of card hold by the customer.
14. Points Earned(`int`) — Points earned by the customer through credit card usage
15. **Exited**(`int`) — **Target feature** that indicate whether the customer left the bank

- Target Variable
  - Exited: `1` = the customer left, `0` = the customer stayed

- Unneeded Variables
1. RowNumber - indicates the row number and this feature doesn't affect analysis
2. CustomerId - A random identifier for customers, which also doesn't influence customer churn
3. Surname - The customer's surname has no impact on their decision to leave the bank

## Data Preprocessing
- Remove irrelevant features: `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`
- Handle missing values: all columns are free with missing values
- Feature Encoding: We need to convert features like `Geography`, `Gender`, `NumberOfProducts`, `HasCrCard`, `Tenure`, `IsActiveMember` using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization: Use plots such as histograms, bar plots, and box plots to explore relationships between variables. 
- Correlation Analysis: We will identify correlations between features and customer churn to select the most relevant predictors. Use `sns.heatmap`

## Feature Engineering

## Model Selection
1. Baseline Model: Logistic Regression
    - Logistic Regrssion is fundamemntal binary classification algorithm.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- With the 10,000 instances of dataset, we will split the dataset into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% test sets. 

## Hyperparameter Tuning

## Conclusion

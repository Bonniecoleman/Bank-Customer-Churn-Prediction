## Overview

This is a Data Science project by Beomseong Kim and Ikjoo Oh under the guidance of mentors John Oh and Arden Kim. We are going to participate in one of the ongoing Kaggle competitions. The goal is to create a model to predict how well one Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) variant will perform against another in a given game, based on a list of features describing the game. This challenge aims to help us determine which MCTS variants work best in different types of games, so we can make more informed choices when applying these algorithms to new problems.
